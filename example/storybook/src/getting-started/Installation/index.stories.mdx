## Quick Start

If you are starting with a new project, you can use `npx` to create a new `gluestack` project.

```bash
npx create-gluestack-v2-app@latest
```

The above command will create a new `gluestack` project.

The directory structure will look like this:

```bash
 /.glue
 /config
 .env.example
 .gitignore
 glue
```

The .glue folder contains an internals folder which contains the core files of the framework. The files present in internals folder contains information related to installed plugins and instances for each plugins. It is not recommended to modify these files.
